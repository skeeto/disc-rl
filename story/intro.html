<h1>Welcome to Disc RL</h1>
<p>
  <b>Disc RL</b> takes place in
  the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron" target="_blank">Tron
  universe</a></b>. You are a program trapped in a hostile, infected
  computer. You need to find the <b>Input/Output Tower</b> so that you
  can re-establish contact with your <b>User</b>. As you travel deeper
  into the internals of this system you will encounter increasing
  levels of <b>corruption</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Your game is automatically saved locally</b>, so it is always
  safe to close this tab. You can visit this page again later to
  continue your game. But remember, <b>death is permanent</b>.
</p>
<h2>Identity Disk</h2>
<p>
  Every program has its own <b>identity disc</b>. It can be used to
  <i>strike other programs</i> or to <i>block attacks</i> (armor). It
  can also be <i>thrown at enemies</i>, automatically
  returning to its owner. However, when thrown, the disc cannot be
  used to block attacks for a short period of time!
