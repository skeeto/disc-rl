<h1>Welcome to Disc RL</h1>
<p>
  <b>Disc RL</b> takes place in
  the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron" target="_blank">Tron
  universe</a></b>. You are a program trapped in a hostile, infected
  computer. You need to find the <b>Input/Output Tower</b> so that you
  can re-establish contact with your <b>User</b>. As you travel deeper
  into the internals of this system you will encounter increasing
  levels of <b>corruption</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Your game is automatically saved locally</b>, so it is always
  safe to close this tab. You can visit this page again later to
  continue your game.
</p>
<h2>Identity Disk</h2>
<p>
  Every program has its own <b>identity disc</b>. It can be used to
  strike other programs as a melee weapon, or it can be thrown at
  enemies (<kbd>f</kbd>), automatically returning to its owner.
</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<table>
  <tr><td><kbd>y</kbd></td><td><kbd>k</kbd></td><td><kbd>u</kbd></td></tr>
  <tr><td><kbd>h</kbd></td><td>@</td><td><kbd>l</kbd></td></tr>
  <tr><td><kbd>b</kbd></td><td><kbd>j</kbd></td><td><kbd>n</kbd></td></tr>

  Movement is just like NetHack. Use the <code>hjkl</code> keys to
  move left, down, up, and right. Use <code>yubn</code> to travel the
  diagonals.
</p>
<p>
  Use <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit this game and start with a new character.
